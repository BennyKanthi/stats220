# STATS220
## About the Project:
This is my repo for **STATS 220**.

I will be using this to demonstrate my learning accumalted within **STATS 220**. The purpose for this README.md file was to practice use of markdown syntax in **Project 1: Creating HTML by combining modern technologies**.

Some of the content within the course includes:
- *Use of R markdown, HTML, CSS*
- *Visual-based communications*
- *Web-based dynamic reporting systems*

## About me:

1. *Playboi Carti*
